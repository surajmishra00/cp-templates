## 🚀 **Features**
- **Pre-written, reusable code snippets** to save time during contests.  
- **Optimized for fast I/O** (C++ code with `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(0)`).  
- **Modular design** for quick customization based on problem needs.  
- **Battle-tested in various contests** (including Codeforces, AtCoder, and USACO).
